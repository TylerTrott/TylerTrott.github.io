    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and (mostly) raised in Bermuda. I 'went pro' in the tennis scene at age 16 officially. I coached and
        played up until 2018 when I decided to pursue a career in Computer Science. I have always had a passion for it
        and felt it was best to pursue it. I began my studies at Bermuda College and obtained an Associate of Science in
        Computer Information Systems in 2020. I then enrolled at Ontario Tech University in the Bachelor of Computer Science
        (Honours) program. I transferred to the University of Victoria in 2023 to complete my degree. With an expected
        graduation date of June 2025, I hope to begin my Post Graduate Diploma of Law at the University of Law in London, UK.
    </p>
    <p> During my time in Bermuda College, I began work at Atsign where I obtained expertise in designing secure systems,
        developing advanced cryptographic technology and innovating security solutions for the IoT and insurance sectors.
        I became adept at forging partnerships to address emerging cybersecurity challenges, crafting strategies
        that integrate advanced security technologies developed by a startup company, and leading critical, high-impact projects.</p>
    <p> During my schooling I have become proficient in threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and secure database management, with a
        strong focus on implementing effective countermeasures and enhancing system resilience.
        Experienced in agile environments, startup ecosystems, and developing secure software solutions using
        C, Python, Java, and SQL. Skilled in leveraging data visualization tools to analyze threats and inform security decisions.</p>
    <p> I have also worked extensively with machine learning theory and artificial intelligence, completing various projects that involve
        PAC learning, support vector machines, boosting, and more. My experience includes developing algorithms for
        linear separators, understanding uniform convergence, and applying information theory concepts like Shannon entropy
        and KL-divergence.</p>
    <p> In addition to my work in AI, I have been involved in networking projects, setting up and configuring web servers,
        and working with tools like Mininet, Hypervisor, and ESXi. My projects often involve integrating various technologies
        to create robust and secure systems, and I have a strong background in both theoretical and practical aspects of
        computer science.</p>
