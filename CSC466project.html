    <h1>Decentralised Federated Learning Framework for Traffic Optimisation in Smart Cities</h1>
    
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project addresses inefficiencies in traffic light synchronization that disrupt traffic flow and waste time. Current systems with intersection-based sensors fail to account for the broader flow of traffic between adjacent intersections. To resolve this, the proposed solution involves developing a decentralized system utilizing IoT devices within a dedicated network and a Federated Learning Framework.</p>
    
    <p>The IoT devices will operate exclusively within their own secure network, collaborating only with each other and the learning algorithm. This ensures seamless peer-to-peer data sharing and processing without external interference. The system will optimize traffic flow using inflow-outflow equations, particularly effective in areas with one-way roads. By collecting real-time traffic data and continuously updating through decentralized learning over days, weeks, and months, the system will enable smart, adaptive synchronization of traffic lights. This approach enhances urban traffic management and minimizes congestion.</p>
    
    <p>Given that this is peer-to-peer networking, Iâ€™ll be analyzing various federated network architectures and some proof of concept for the sensors to be capable of existing in such an infrastructure. The learning portion will be covered through my mathematical proofs during my time in CSC 431 which should, by the time of the project submission date, be fleshed out enough to detail a proof of concept plan, what implementation would look like, resources required, etc. It is unlikely that I will be able to flesh out anything physically but have found an open-source project that actually displays the number of red vs green lights on top of the number of cars waiting vs the number of cars flowing, which will help with the math proofs and playing around with the communication between sensors at intersections.
