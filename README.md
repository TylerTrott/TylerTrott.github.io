## Software Engineering Projects

### at_c
**Description:** The alpha C implementation of the atSDK for the at_platform. This project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. The atSDK is a set of libraries that allow developers to build applications that use the at_platform. The atSDK is designed to be easy to use and to provide a high level of security and privacy for users.

**What I did:** I contributed the beginning of the ed25519 implementation in addition to adding tests cases for RSA 4096 operability.

**Description:** Clean Choice is a web app that informs you on other environmentally friendly alternatives to products you purchased. Upon generating a receipt, a QR code is generated where your receipt details will inform you on the carbon footprint of your purchase and recommend other products that have a greener impact on the environment.

**Technologies Used:** 
There are multiple components to this project:

- Web App (React, Tailwind)
- Database (Google Cloud, MySQL)
- API Scripts & Functions (Node.js, SerpAPI, Ditch Carbon)
- Receipt generation (Node.js)

### ATP-Tour-Analytics-2022
**Description:** I am a big tennis fan and I wanted to create a project that would allow me to analyze the ATP Tour data. The project was for a data science course I took at Ontario Tech University. The project involved analyzing the ATP Tour data from 2022 and creating visualizations to show the trends and patterns in the data.

**Technologies Used:** R, API Scripts (Node.js)

### Medium
**Description:** I have written several articles on Medium about software engineering, cybersecurity, and other topics. Unfortunately, as my account was created with my Atsign email, I no longer have access to these personally uploaded blogs. However, the main company page still exists where I contributed much of the work. I have also added my personal page.

### AtsignCo Youtube
**Description:** During my tenure at Atsign, I was in charge of the YouTube channel. I had created several video tutorials for the atSDK libraries, using Atsign technology, amongst hosting evetns for our developer community. In addition to these, I also hosted several podcasts on the channel. The video tutorials themselves covered the installation, configuration, and usage of the atSDK libraries and atProtocol itself. The video tutorials also included code examples and tutorials to help developers get started with the atSDK.
